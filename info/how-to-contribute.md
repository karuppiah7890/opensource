# How to Contribute?

This is a question that many people ask when starting out with open source
software. There's no easy or straight foward answer here. If you have this
question, and you want someone to help you, you can only expect them to help
you in terms of finding the answer, but can't give you the answer, it's
because only you can answer this question. Let me explain more on this.

`How to Contribute?` is a broad question. Let's split it. And answer them too!

`Contribute to what?` - I'll assume we are going with Open Source Software, since
I don't know the other domains like Open Source Hardware, or Open Source Art.

Now that we have fixed ourselves on Open Source Software, let's ask more
questions. Remember, the goal is to narrow down to one thing and do an action
to get some outcome, which is based on a goal, to move towards the goal.

```
Contribute to which project? Where do I find projects? Once I find the project,
how do I know what I can help with? Once I know what I can help with, how to
do it in action?
```

To start with, when you have these questions and you asked them to me, to help
you, I would ask you back some questions to help you answer your own questions,
since it's all up to you. The questions I would ask or the points I would give
you are

What's your goal? What's your `Why?`?

Are you contributing to Open Source just to get the hang of it? Are you
contributing to get a goodie (T Shirt, and other swag. I have done it :P)?
Are you contributing to understand or learn something, like a concept
(example: TDD, Distributed Systems, Database), a tool or a framework or a
programming language? Are you contributing to get into an Open Source project
based company? Are you contributing to help the project as you use it? Are you
contributing to become an expert in something, like the project or some concept
or something? Are you contributing because you like some field and want to
advance the field in the industry? Are you contributing because you just like to
solve problems, some really hard problems?

You can ask such questions and more to understand your goals. My initial goals
in contributing to Open Source Software were very simple - contribute and get
tee shirt. Like through Hacktoberfest event, and similar programs.

It's fine if you have not thought about it or are not sure about your goals, and
want to contribute simply to try a hand at it and explore. It's really cool to
actually explore to see how you like it and what you like!

The goals or the `Why?` could help you narrow down to some stuff and help you
reject some stuff. And focus and narrow down on one thing, so that you can get
started and contribute instead of being overwhelmed by thinking you don't know
what to contribute to.

Some more things that can you narrow down is
- Programming language

If your goal is to learn a programming language by contributing to open source,
you would choose a project which is written in a language you have never worked
with. Another case where you would choose a project with an unknown language is,
the project matches with your other goals, constraints and is a good match, and
you don't want programming language to be a deal breaker, so you just jump in
and learn the language on the go and also contribute to the project

In other cases, you will usually be choosing a project where you know the
programming language the project uses. Let's assume you know JavaScript. Now,
you could start checking out projects in JavaScript. 

- What software do you use every day?

Everyone works with some sort of software in their day job. If you are looking
for projects, one of the easiest ways is to choose a project that you have
already used or have heard of. No exploration really needed. This would also
mean you are getting more familiar with the software you are using in your
day to day job or softwares that you keep hearing about and haven't tried out.
Some generic examples - it could be tools like command line tools (CLI), fancy graphical
user interface (GUI) tools, libraries, frameworks or even programming languages
and their ecosystem of software and tools!

Some specific examples - let's say you work with Spring Boot Java framework,
or some Java library like Gson and there are tons of other libraries, or some
testing software like Junit, you could actually go check out the source code
for these softwares as they are all open source and you can contribute to them
too!

- What domain do you like?

There are so many domains in software today. All of them being big oceans. Some
of the domains I know are - Web apps (frontend and backend services), Mobile
apps, Desktop apps, IoT, Infrastructure (Cloud, Kubernetes, Nomad, Docker),
Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Engineering (DE),
Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), or the cross
cutting term is XR where X is the variable (A or V or M) and there are probably
tons more, which I don't know. Like there's robotics related software, medicine
related software, hacking (white hat) and security stuff. There's software
almost everywhere - Cars, Rockets, Elevators and what not. 

So, choose a domain that you like and are interested in, and look for open
source projects in such domains! :)

To answer the `Where do I find projects?`, there are some source code hosting
sites for it :) Some of them are

- GitHub. It's pretty damn famous (for good or bad) and is kind of ruling is
what I believe. It's the home and host of tons of open source softwares out
there. It also has some mirrored repositories, meaning repositories whose actual
source code (original) is somewhere else and the mirror or copy is present in
GitHub. GitHub has tons of features and is a company recently acquired by
Microsoft. And Hacktoberfest event by DigitalOcean is usually conducted by
partnering with GitHub where people are asked to contribute to open source
projects on GitHub and get goodies only for that.

- GitLab. This is pretty damn famous too. GitLab by itself is an open source
company with multiple open source products / softwares and enterprise products
with enterprise features. The company is very very open. They are also a
completely remote company and they have also open sourced their handbook with
which they run their company. It's a pretty awesome company. The app
gitlab.com is the home for lots of open source softwares including the open
source version of GitLab called GitLab CE (community edition), along with it's
ecosystem of tools and software, like gitlab runner, gitaly, to name a few.

- BitBucket. It's a famous software by Atlassian a famous company with it's
famous set of products for software development. You can find open source
software here too, though I have not personally used it.

- SourceForget. It's an old application is what I think (not sure). I have seen
quite some old softwares being hosted there.

Those are some of the source code hosting websites that I know of. You can
search for open source softwares there. Personally I always keep searching in
GitHub, and it has a lot of the softwares that I use or hear about. But you
don't have to limit yourselves to it.

Also, there are many softwares that host their source code in their own site
and you need to use them.

Any source code hosting site will have some set of source versioning tools or
systems that it supports. So, you need to know them too in a basic manner, to
work with the different versions of the software and to contribute too.

Source code versioning tools - I have usually worked with softwares that use
`git`, the famous version control system tool. There are so many other tools
out there, that are used by some softwares for their source code versioning.
Some VCS tools I have heard of are - subversion (SVN), mercurial (hg), CVS.

Once you have found a project to work on. You can now think about what kind of
contribution you want to do and then accordingly do an action based on that.

Now, before doing any sort of contribution, I would first highly recommend to
just simply know about the software, use the software, so that you understand
about it. This is a very good thing to do at the first if it's your first time
working with the software / project.

You can explore about the project and probably it's ecosystem too.

# How to Contribute?

This is a question that many people ask when starting out with open source
software. There's no easy or straight foward answer here. If you have this
question, and you want someone to help you, you can only expect them to help
you in terms of finding the answer, but can't give you the answer, it's
because only you can answer this question. Let me explain more on this.

`How to Contribute?` is a broad question. Let's split it. And answer them too!

`Contribute to what?` - I'll assume we are going with Open Source Software, since
I don't know the other domains like Open Source Hardware, or Open Source Art.

Now that we have fixed ourselves on Open Source Software, let's ask more
questions. Remember, the goal is to narrow down to one thing and do an action
to get some outcome, which is based on a goal, to move towards the goal.

```
Contribute to which project? Where do I find projects? Once I find the project,
how do I know what I can help with? Once I know what I can help with, how to
do it in action?
```

To start with, when you have these questions and you asked them to me, to help
you, I would ask you back some questions to help you answer your own questions,
since it's all up to you. The questions I would ask or the points I would give
you are

What's your goal? What's your `Why?`?

Are you contributing to Open Source just to get the hang of it? Are you
contributing to get a goodie (T Shirt, and other swag. I have done it :P)?
Are you contributing to understand or learn something, like a concept
(example: TDD, Distributed Systems, Database), a tool or a framework or a
programming language? Are you contributing to get into an Open Source project
based company? Are you contributing to help the project as you use it? Are you
contributing to become an expert in something, like the project or some concept
or something? Are you contributing because you like some field and want to
advance the field in the industry? Are you contributing because you just like to
solve problems, some really hard problems?

You can ask such questions and more to understand your goals. My initial goals
in contributing to Open Source Software were very simple - contribute and get
tee shirt. Like through Hacktoberfest event, and similar programs.

It's fine if you have not thought about it or are not sure about your goals, and
want to contribute simply to try a hand at it and explore. It's really cool to
actually explore to see how you like it and what you like!

The goals or the `Why?` could help you narrow down to some stuff and help you
reject some stuff. And focus and narrow down on one thing, so that you can get
started and contribute instead of being overwhelmed by thinking you don't know
what to contribute to.

Some more things that can you narrow down is
- Programming language

If your goal is to learn a programming language by contributing to open source,
you would choose a project which is written in a language you have never worked
with. Another case where you would choose a project with an unknown language is,
the project matches with your other goals, constraints and is a good match, and
you don't want programming language to be a deal breaker, so you just jump in
and learn the language on the go and also contribute to the project

In other cases, you will usually be choosing a project where you know the
programming language the project uses. Let's assume you know JavaScript. Now,
you could start checking out projects in JavaScript. 

- What software do you use every day?

Everyone works with some sort of software in their day job. If you are looking
for projects, one of the easiest ways is to choose a project that you have
already used or have heard of. No exploration really needed. This would also
mean you are getting more familiar with the software you are using in your
day to day job or softwares that you keep hearing about and haven't tried out.
Some generic examples - it could be tools like command line tools (CLI), fancy graphical
user interface (GUI) tools, libraries, frameworks or even programming languages
and their ecosystem of software and tools!

Some specific examples - let's say you work with Spring Boot Java framework,
or some Java library like Gson and there are tons of other libraries, or some
testing software like Junit, you could actually go check out the source code
for these softwares as they are all open source and you can contribute to them
too!

- What domain do you like?

There are so many domains in software today. All of them being big oceans. Some
of the domains I know are - Web apps (frontend and backend services), Mobile
apps, Desktop apps, IoT, Infrastructure (Cloud, Kubernetes, Nomad, Docker),
Artificial Intelligence(AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Engineering (DE),
Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), or the cross
cutting term is XR where X is the variable (A or V or M) and there are probably
tons more, which I don't know. Like there's robotics related software, medicine
related software, hacking (white hat) and security stuff. There's software
almost everywhere - Cars, Rockets, Elevators and what not. 

So, choose a domain that you like and are interested in, and look for open
source projects in such domains! :)

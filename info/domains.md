# Domains

Open Source is a very very broad term. If you notice, I mentioned `Open Source`
and not `Open Source Software`. That's because Open Source is present in other
domains too, and not just software development.

A few of the domains that I know of are
1. Open Source Hardware
I have only heard of this term. The vague idea I have here is - similar to
open source software, here, the blue print of the hardware is open or public.
More like how to build the hardware. But that's all I know or assume to know.
It's something you can dig about :)

2. Open Source Art
Not sure if this is a term. I need to research :P But I do know this - people
create digital art (music, logos, paintings etc) and also take digital photos
and post it online. They are not always free and have some license and cost to
it for usage. Sometimes you can see artists giving it away for free, with a
request from the artist for attribution in the place it's used. An example
being - you can see people adding images to their blog posts and attributing it
to the artist of the image, under the image. Some artists also mention a license
for their art, similar to open source software licenses. Creative Commons is a
set of such licenses. You can check more about it here

3. Open Source Software
I think many people know about Open Source Software now. :) Open Source Software
is software whose source (source code) is open (public). Open Source Software
does not really mean free software (freeware), it just means source code is
open. Since the source code is open, people can see it, download it, run it,
modify it and use it. They could distribute the software as is or they could
also distribute the modified (by them) software. Usually, when it comes to
distribution and distribution of modified open source software, you need to be
aware of some legal stuff. This is where the concept of open source licenses
come in usually. Whenever you are planning to do something with open source
software, it's good to check the license they have and what are it's boundaries
and limitations and if you usage complies to the license. And Open Source
Software has multiple licenses. Too many actually. I usually get confused with
some of them. But there are sites to help you with such licensing. And did you
know that lawyers learn about Open Source software and help with legal stuff
related to Open Source licensing? Cool right?

Each project has it's own CONTRIBUTING.md file and it's own rules and methods and processes to contribute.

Some use github issues, some use mailing lists (example rabbitmq-server)

Benefits of contributing - you learn more based on your experience. It could be about design, 
it could be about code, it could about methods like TDD, it could be communication, it could be
connecting with many people, it could be possible jobs in an open source company, and it's surely
something to be proud of in your resume - that you do open source.

 Always join the community to learn from the community, to do discussions and also connect with the community.

Always try out the latest version of the software - previews/alphas/betas/release candidates. That's where you find more bugs or weird behavior, especially in new major versions.

Projects are always running, unless new features have stopped and the developers think it's stable and don't even do bug fixes or anything. Or else usually there's always features and bug fixes and security fixes

Community Calls / Meetups / Standups. Special Interest Groups.

Usually I have noticed that bugs are easy to contribute to, in my experience, and that it also gives a lot of experience. But people also contribute docs or even features. 

Understand the concept of RFCs (Request For Comments) / proposals / discussing, for new features or anything, before writing any piece of code.

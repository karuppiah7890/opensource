# GoCD Google Chat notifier plugin

A colleague of mine asked me if I could build a GoCD plugin to send notifications
to Google Chat for build results - mainly failures. Some people asked for
build passes too. 

Currently I wrote quite some code - I think, like, lots of code. With tests
and all. The problem is, the code looks quite messy now. Like, very very
messy. I need to clean it up before building a new feature I think. I was
struggling to build the last feature I was trying to build - something related
to plugin configurations I think.

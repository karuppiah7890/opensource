# Rabbit Email

Repo:
https://github.com/karuppiah7890/rabbit-email

The idea was to create something like https://sendy.co/ , 
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/mail-for-good and similar.

Mail For Good is nice. I just wanted to write something in Golang, a different
stack and also make the architecture a bit better? I don't know what I was
thinking. May be I'll have to re-evaluate my decisions and see if I still plan
to build this and why. The idea was mostly to build a product, to earn some
money :P Mail For Good looked complex to me - may be because I didn't
understand NodeJS :P Also, For Rabbit Email, I was thinking I could probably
reuse Mail For Good UI and just have a different backend or something - I think
the reason for this decision was because I'm very bad at UI, so yeah :P

# check-test-coverage

One thing that I do when manually reviewing a PR is - check for tests. I would
like to get the help of automation to augment the PR to show which code has
been added and if it's been tested or not

This test coverage can help with checking the coverage at a simple level - unit
tests. And unit tests are the most important. It's very possible that there are
other kinds of tests - integration tests and what not, but at least for unit
test coverage - we can check how much of the PR code is covered in the tests
and how much is not. This can help recommend to the PR owner to add tests to
their PR to help make it more robust!

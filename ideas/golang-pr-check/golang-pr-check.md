# golang-pr-check

A CLI tool / service to help with checking a Golang project Pull Request

Features
1. [Check for breaking changes by the PR](check-for-breaking-changes.md)
2. [Check for test coverage for code of the PR](check-test-coverage.md)

To start with MVP, a tool is enough. Ideally a service is better so that we
can show the results immediately at the click of a link just near the PR!

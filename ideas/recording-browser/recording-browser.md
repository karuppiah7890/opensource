# Recording Browser

I have been having a set of ideas related to collaboration tools for a long time

Most of these ideas are related to real time collaboration by two or maybe more
people. As the first steps to building these tools, I'm learning how to do some
basic things and some basic problems which I think are a bit part of the
bigger problem of collaboration tools

One of the problems that I keep thinking about is - how to record something?
Some action?

For example, how to record what I'm doing on a terminal? I can use a screen
recorder. It will create a video, in some video format like mp4. But that's
heavy weight. Asciinema tool can do it way better and light weight and the
resolution to play the recording is perfect unlike video resolutions - there's
also recording resolution which is what shows up in playing unless there was
editing done. At least that's what I know.

So, recording terminals, text editors, and any other tools is the idea that I
have for now.

As part of that, recording browser is the new idea. One can record using a
screen recording tool. And it will be perfect too.

But I want to record in a different and more light weight format. At least I
assume it's light weight. I don't know. I gotta check.

I have had similar ideas before but the repo that instilled more curiosity in
me was -

This repo tells how we can check a .mov file to check the progress as a demo.

I was thinking how we can use a different kind of file to record web pages. But
yeah there can be disadvantages to recording a web page in the way I think. For
example, when recording a webpage by recording the HTML, CSS and Js in it, and
the changes in it, and maybe the mouse movements and clicks and what not, the
tricky part is, if you record in firefox and play it back on chrome, it might
look different as we would be rendering the web page using HTML, CSS and Js and
it may look different on different browsers. Unless it was taken care of as part
of the code. Also, another thing is - size. If we increase browser window size
or decrease it, the recording or the playing will get affected I think. Surely
the playing might be different. But that's not the case with videos. It's
always the same given the size of the player - small means smaller size, and
also if the resolution is same, it looks the same. So, yeah. Also, with
web page recording, only if done well maybe it can look the same in firefox I
think. Or else maybe even in firefox it might play bad even though it was
recorded on the same firefox (same version etc)

The only good thing about recording HTML, CSS, Js and stuff is, it will be light
weight. Or maybe it may not be light weight.

For example, if you want to record a web search engine image results web page,
and if the images have really high resolution, then your recording will store
all those images. It might get bigger than a video - maybe. Maybe. I just don't
know. Also, if you want, you can ignore storing images etc, and any and all
artifacts like Js, CSS. But the player may not work in some cases. Not sure.
The benefit of storing all the artifacts is that - you won't need Internet to
browse then! :) You just need the recording locally, offline. It will all work
fine. :) No need to have Internet. You can still play the recording. So, yeah.
It's an interesting problem I guess. Hmm

It will be a problem of thinking in terms of times and frames like movies. I'm
already solving a similar problem using web text editors

Let's see how that goes. I might work on this too! :) Some day! :)

# Searching for PRs with filters

I was wondering about how cool it would be to be able to search GitHub PRs with filters like "Show me recent PRs, like within 10 days, with just one line of code change or say less than 10 lines of code change"

I'm not sure if GitHub has advanced search for PRs, I think it might, something to checkout, or else we would need a tool to do this so that people can review small PRs quickly and have some quick wins ;)

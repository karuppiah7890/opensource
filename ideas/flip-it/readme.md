# Flip It

The idea is to clone the features of this App - 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rectfy.cropimage
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rectfy.flip

And similar apps whose main features are to Rotate images - any degrees, Flip
images - horizontally and vertically, and also Crop images

I was planning to create an App just for flipping images.

I started off the App - https://github.com/karuppiah7890/flipit/

I even tried it out in my mobile. I used this library for image processing -

Spectrum
https://github.com/facebookincubator/spectrum
https://libspectrum.io/

And I even published the app after trying it out in my emulator and a few
times on my local device. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.karuppiah7890.flipit

Unfortunately the App crashed for some reasons I still don't know. And then
I didn't look into it. :/ 

So, it never worked even once after downloading from play store. And for me,
in my local, it didn't install on my device any more due to some corruption
issue - it said it cannot be installed - more like saying - it's already there
or something and some issue. I have to get back to that issue and also the
crash issue. Someone even commented on the app page ðŸ™ˆ 

I just found out how to use the developer console and reply to reviews. There's
a section for user feedback. I used that and replied to that one good person
who tried my app. I think many others tried it too! ðŸ˜…

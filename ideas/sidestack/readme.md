# sidestack

If I ever create a company, I think I might name it this? ;) Inspiration -
substack (the twitter, github and npm username and the substack.com site)

## thoughts

Side Stack
* More like doing work always on the side? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
* Like, doing important or cool or effective work when doing work on the side? :P
* Other times have a main job or no job ðŸ¤£
* And a company that's always running but people come only three days per week? 
Like some come on Mon Tue Wed, others come on Wed Thur Fri? Or any three days
including Sat Sun may be? ;) Or just make Sat and Sun to be compulsory holidays?
;) It depends I guess. But surely only three days :P

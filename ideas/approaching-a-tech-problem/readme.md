# approaching-a-problem

Approaching a tech problem
1. First understand the problem. Define it. Define it very well before solving
it!
2. Look very hard for existing solutions. Just to understand their features.
This will also be useful if you want to create any differentiating features
or do somethings better which is probably a yes
3. Look for research papers on the topic
4. Find every information you can find on the topic, and see if and how it helps
solve the problem
5. Remember, information is value!
6. Write down the issues you face on the way. And how you fixed it.
This will help you atleast be able to look back in case you face the same issues
again. 
7. Software, tools, code, SaaS etc - everything is about people. And people have
stories. Everything has a story. Make sure you know your story in your journey!
Even if you fail, you will have a story to tell - which is a big thing by
itself. So yeah, it's not always about the destination - it's about the
journey! 
8. Make sure you don't make your life harder and instead make it easier
while writing code! :)
9. Look for blog articles
10. Look for YouTube and other site videos (individual, channels, playlists) of tutorials, meetups, conferences, bootcamps etc

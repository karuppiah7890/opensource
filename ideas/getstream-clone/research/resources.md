getstream.io authors have written an open source stream framework in python! :)

grpc can be used to easily be able to auto generate code for clients in different languages.

If I need to create an open source chat app or a service to provide chat APIs
like getstream, I need to understand and see if I really need to create everything
from scratch. I mean, yes, it's surely reinventing the wheel üôà so, I'll have to
see my goals. But let's just say I'm not going to reinvent the wheel when it
comes to ideas and specifications and protocols. I'm just going to stick with
what's already out there. I mean, I have seen the below cool open source
messaging platforms

So, may be I don't really need to write every piece of code. And I surely don't
have to think too much about design and architecture and protocol. It shouldn't
be that hard. So, I guess it's just a matter of putting it all together and
seeing how it all works together ;)

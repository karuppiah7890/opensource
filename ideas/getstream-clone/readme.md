# getstream-clone

[getstream](https://getstream.io) seems like a cool service that helps you to
add feed and chat features to your app.

They take pride in the fact that they are fast and are scalable. Seems cool to
build something like that.

I'm sure there are probably tons of open source software that solve this when
creating a social network app. I would still like to build something like this,
especially test it for scale with load tests and see how it comes out! :)

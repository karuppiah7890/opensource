For remote mouse and keyboard control feature. One solution is this - 

Considering both the people are on MacOS. One person can access another person's
mouse and keyboard and control it. Both will install an app in their system,
and then exactly one person will be able to control the other person's mouse
and keyboard

How? MacOS has this feature of controlling mouse through code - they provide
APIs for this. Some links are here -

Note: Need to add links to the learning log files that I wrote while trying
to build a demo app

For real time collaboration on docs, I started digging into things

Firepad - based on Firebase. Open Source

https://firepad.io/
https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firepad

What I could check is - how does it work? Apparently it uses some code editor
softwares like CodeMirror and Ace.  https://codemirror.net/ https://ace.c9.io/
But that will come by default for visual
studio code and other editors if I'm building it as a plugin to an editor. 
And I gotta see how it works along with Firebase. May be I could plugin
something else instead of Firebase, something for which I don't have to pay too
much. Let's see. Of course it comes at maintenance cost. Hmm.

The demo works quite well.

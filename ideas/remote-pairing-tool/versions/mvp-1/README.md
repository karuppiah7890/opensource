# MVP 1

High level features:

1. Support for two users only
2. One user can connect to another user's computer and
control their mouse. - Be able to just move their mouse

Note: The user CANNOT see the other user's computer and cannot control
their keyboard. That's out of scope.

UI/UX -> make it as minimalistic as possible to achieve the above two features.

Note: Focus only on the above two features. Anything else - like other features,
including Cross Functional Features (CFR, XFR) can be taken up later. It's okay!

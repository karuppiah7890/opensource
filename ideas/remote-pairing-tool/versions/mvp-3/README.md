# MVP 3

High level features:

1. Support for two users only
2. Support for VS Code only
2. One user can connect to another user's computer and
work on a file collaboratively

UI/UX -> make it as minimalistic as possible to achieve the above features.

Note: Focus only on the above features. Anything else - like other features,
including Cross Functional Features (CFR, XFR) can be taken up later. It's okay!

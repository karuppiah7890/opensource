# MVP 2.1

High level features:

1. Support for VS Code only
2. Show more than one cursor in a file and control
it's position
3. Color the cursors
4. Show a name on hovering over the cursor

UI/UX -> make it as minimalistic as possible to achieve the above features.

Note: Focus only on the above features. Anything else - like other features,
including Cross Functional Features (CFR, XFR) can be taken up later. It's okay!

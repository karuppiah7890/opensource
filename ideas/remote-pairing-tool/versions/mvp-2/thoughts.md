I think the first thing to do is - do a spike on how to create a VS Code
extension

And then the next thing to do is - see if the project file structure information
can be obtained and if yes, how to obtain it

And then the next thing to do is - see how to modify the sidebar to show
project structure or anything, even though the computer does not have that
in it's local system - as that would be the case for the other user who would
be trying to access another user's system to see the project file structure

Each one of these would be a spike I think

And then I gotta see how to publish it in the marketplace - as that's how
extensions are distributed, so yeah

And also put some license key like stuff so that not everyone can use it!
May be put some TOTP based password? Or for now, just some random password.
Gotta see :) How to do it and if it's needed. Again. Spike ;) 

And then finally put it all together and that's it ;) I guess it's just a
bunch of spikes put together to make an MVP ðŸ¤£

doesn't exist anymore because [slack acquired them](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/video-conferencing)
and integrated the features into [slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/) app
* [Screen](https://screen.so/) - The cofounder of Screenhero created screen,

* [Visual Studio Code Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/15/live-share) - has
code editor, terminal shared. Audio and
Video - not sure. A friend told me you can use your own plugins to see different
fonts, colors and theme, compared to the other user's fonts, colors and theme.
It felt like a cool thing! Need to research more to understand it better. More links -
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/

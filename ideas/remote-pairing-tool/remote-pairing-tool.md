# remote pairing tool

I'm seeing a lot of tools for helping with remote pairing. Like a LOOOOT
of tools. Some examples are [here](existing-tools.md)


There might be more. I guess I'll do more of my research on it sooner or later.
I also like to see the story behind services and tools, even though they may
not be really the true story, or may not be the only true story. Anyways,
looking at all this and the cool features of Mac's built in screen sharing
that I tried long ago once, it feels like these are some really cool things to
build!

I really want to build this kind of tool - one because it's cool, of course,
like, it's hard, yes, I mean so many people are building these kind of tools,
and putting in a lot of work - some of them lots of years of work. For me, the
kick is in the fact that - I want to try some open source version of these and
of course may be see if I can earn some money if it really hits it off! I mean,
I know it sounds like one of those "kids" telling they have the next million
dollar or billion dollar idea for the coolest mobile app or whatever, I really
think I could do something like this and at least have some learnings from it,
and also may be earn a bit probably - having one's own product does sound cool
too :P For me that is. Let's see how that goes! :)

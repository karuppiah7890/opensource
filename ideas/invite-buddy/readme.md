# Invite Buddy

This was based on this idea - 

https://github.com/open-source-ideas/open-source-ideas/issues/101

I started it off. I was enthusiastic. And then nothing much happened. It's
been an year now. 

Some of the problems with the code are - it's unnecessarily too complex to
build it - I think it's mainly because of my dumb decision to choose this thing
called https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo which is an ecosystem and helps
with rapid application development, but that's only true when you know it very
well and stuff. I think it's not needed at all. And I think I used sqlite? Idk.
That was also a think that I was thinking on - ability to support both sqlite
and postgres or something. So yeah, those are the thoughts on that. I need to
recall more on it and write a whole lot of things on it

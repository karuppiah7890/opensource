As of this writing, I'm currently working
on this feature in a mobile app - which is
a social platform - like Instagram, Facebook.
And this feature is about tagging users in
a comment and later in a post too. 

For this we wanted to show the user 
suggestions in the comment box when they
typed a `@` symbol, so that they can search
for users and then select a user to choose
them, to tag the user in the comment or
post or anyhwhere.

We were looking at how to do the custom
view, and later started searching for 
libraries and found this good library

https://github.com/hendraanggrian/socialview

As usual the developer in me wanted to
create something like this while I was
furiously searching for it :P :P

Now that it's there, I still want to create
it :P. With more customization options and all
as it kinda looks like the above library
does not have the customization we are 
looking for. idk if that's even possible.
I would know only if I have done android a 
lot. But unfortunately idk much android 
stuff for now, so I'm not doing it yet. But 
I would love to do it! :D After analyzing about
it :P ;) It would be so cool! ;) Since idk anything
about Android now. I would learn a thing or two then!

Raise an issue in socialview repo
and ask them to include this

```
android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan|adjustResize"
```

in example activity in the manifest. so
that when input
box is at the bottom of the screen,
the suggestions still show up above
the box! :)

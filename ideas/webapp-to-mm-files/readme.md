# Webapp to view .mm files

`.mm` file refers to a mindmap file. Recently I exported a mindmap into a `.mm`
file but couldn't find a tool to visualize. I mean, an easy online tool. I did
look in github and found one worth it python thing I guess. I didn't try it
though. Looking at the readme, the demos looked good but trying something in
python was too much effort 😛 and it used some custom GUI to show things. I
wanted a neat webapp instead 🤷‍♂ Let me get those links that I looked at. Might
be useful. And again, maybe I didn't look for the tool enough. I could look
again before building :P ;)

# Browser Extension To Delete History

Create a browser extension for Firefox and maybe for Chrome too, which will
take an input string and delete all history which has that input string in
it's website title, or website url.

I tried to look for such an extension, but found only extensions that look at
website url, but not title. ðŸ˜… Maybe I didn't do my search well. Anyways

The idea is to stream audio in a local network in client server fashion or P2P
fashion. But if video can be streamed, then that's awesome too! :P ;)

I'm yet to read stuff, but I can clearly see a lot of mentions about
Motion Corporation. I mean, I'm surprised at the amount of advertisement it
gets in an open community, which I believe was into open source. I can see that
the community has the people from the corporation and they are the ones who
did the research and they have it all in the open, except for one part I think.
Something called a Timing Provider, and is an online service. They have mentioned
the API of this service and have mentioned that Motion Corporation will take
care of it. It's a free service, for a limited number of people it seems. And
then it's paid for commercial use. I mean, all this is fine. Either they should
have just not advertised the company so much in each and every doc of this thing,
or they could have just open sourced some version of the online service. But yeah,
that would be a bad position for the company. Anyways, I can see an open source
implementation. That's good! 

I'm still annoyed though. I mean, I agree people need to earn money, in which
case they should no go and contribute to open standards and be part of the
open standards w3c community and then do research and insert their company's
name as a plug. Not sure if that's okay.

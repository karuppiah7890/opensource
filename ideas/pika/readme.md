# Pika

The idea was to create a command line tool to book rooms for meetings. I started
it off and then didn't do much. I also did some research on existing tools,
there were quite some good ones actually. I think I need to first do some
research on what will be the features of the tool and what's really needed and
what kind of problem it solves and then build it. I did write it's features
and stuff somewhere. Will have to get hold of that first
